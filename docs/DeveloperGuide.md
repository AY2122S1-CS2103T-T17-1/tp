### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T17-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `RhrhParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `RhrhParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddSupplierCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddSupplierCommand`) which the `RhrhParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddSupplierCommandParser`, `DeleteSupplierCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Customer`, `Employee`, `Supplier` and `Reservation` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueCustomerList`, `UniqueEmployeeList`, `UniqueSupplierList` and `UniqueReservationList` object respectively).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Customer`/`Employee`/`Supplier`/`Reservation` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Customer>`/`ObservableList<Employee>`/`ObservableList<Supplier>`/`ObservableList<Reservation>` respectively that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `Rhrh`, which `Person` references. This allows `Rhrh` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `RhrhStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Add command

In the following section, we would be using the example of adding an `Employee` to RHRH. We can add a `Customer`
and `Supplier` the using a similar format with their own fields and command, and the logic behind how another Person Type is added will be the same. More information on the differences in adding `Customer`, `Employee` and `Supplier` can be found in our [User Guide](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T17-4/tp/blob/master/docs/UserGuide.md)

#### Current Implementation

{:no_toc}

The AddEmployeeCommand creates an Employee and adds it into the current Employee's list. In the Class Diagram below, we can see what is created when we call upon the 
AddEmployeeCommand

<img src="images/AddEmployeeCommandClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

An AddEmployeeCommand is created through the usage of our `addE` command.

The process in which an `Employee` is added can be broken down into 2.

1. User input is sent into the `RhrhParser` and an `AddEmployeeCommand` is created.
2. The `AddEmployeeCommand` then proceeds to add the created `Employee` to RHRH.

In the first step, the user input is parsed in `AddEmployeeCommandParser` and broken down for other methods from other classes to create an `AddEmployeeCommand`.
This is depicted in the Sequence Diagram below.

<img src="images/AddEmployeeCommandSequenceDiagram.png" width="550" />

After obtaining the `AddEmployeeCommand`, it then calls methods in `Model` to help add the newly created `Employee` to the existing `UniqueEmployeeList`.

<img src="images/AddEmployeeCommandActivityDiagram.png" width="550" />

### Design Considerations

* Current Design: We separated `AddEmployeeCommmand`, `AddCustomerCommmand` and `AddSupplierCommmand` as different command types.
This is evident in our differing Edit and Delete commands as well.
  * Pros
    * It is much neater as everything is divided based on the Person type and prefixes are easily separated based on whichever Person Type it is.
    * Errors in user input is easier to identify due to the separation of Person type.
    
  * Cons
    * Additional classes had to be implemented.
    * More commands for a similar feature.

* Alternative Design: We could have a singular `AddCommand` and parse the user's input to see what Person Type the user wanted to add.
  * Pros
    * Fewer commands for the user to remember.
      
  * Cons
    * Error messages would have been confusing to select.
    

### Customer

### Proposed alternative considerations

* `CustomerList` is always sorted by date and time

### Employee

### Proposed alternative considerations

* `EmployeeList` is always sorted by date and time

### Supplier

### Proposed alternative considerations

* `SupplierList` is always sorted by date and time

### Reserve Command

#### Implementation

#### Proposed alternative considerations

* `ReservationList` is always sorted by date and time

* `ReservationList` checks for time crash before adding a new `Reservation`

### Set Tables Command

#### Implementation

Set Tables command `[settables]` takes in a list of numbers as arguments and creates a TableList that is stored in the ModelManager

An AddEmployeeCommand is created through the usage of our addE command.

The process in which an Employee is added can be broken down into 2.

1. User input is sent into the RhrhParser and a SetTablesCommand is created.

2. The SetTablesCommand then proceeds to create and add the new tables to RHRH.

In the first step, the user input is parsed in SetTableCommandParser and broken down for other methods from other classes to create a SetTablesCommand. This is depicted in the Sequence Diagram below. 

![SetTablesSequenceDiagram](images/SetTablesSequenceDiagram.png)

Once the SetTablesCommand is created, the LogicManager will then execute the SetTablesCommand and add the newly created list of tables to the model

Finally, a success message is printed to the user saying how many tables were set

##### Flow of execution

The activity diagram below shows the flow of execution when a user calls this command together with the details when SetTablesCommand is executed

![SetTablesActivityDiagram](images/SetTablesActivityDiagram.png)

After user calls the command:

1. Command syntax and user input arguments are checked if they are valid

2. User input arguments are parsed and a SetTablesCommand is created and executed

During the SetTablesCommand execution:

1. The Table ID will be reset

2. All current reservations will be removed

3. New tables with the specified sizes will be created and added into a new list

4. New list of tables will overwrite the old list of tables in the TableManager inside the RHRH

#### Design Considerations

1. User is allowed to format the argument for table sizes as a singular table size (e.g. `2` = 1 table that accommodates 2 people) or, with an `x` for multiple tables with the same size (e.g. `10x3` = 3 tables that accommodate 10 people)
    * This is because we find that in an actual restaurant, there will be many tables with the same sizes so this allows the user to set the tables faster without repeating the table sizes many times. Hence, the design choice is to allow for these `x` syntax.


2. Table IDs will be reset to start from 1
   * This is because we want the new set of tables to have the correct table IDs starting from 1 and not be affected by the old set of tables


3. All current reservations will be removed
    * This is because each reservation is linked to exactly one table so changing the tables in the restaurant will mess up the reservation and thus the reservations and tables will not be in sync. Hence, the design choice is to remove all reservations.


4. There is no add/remove/edit table or table list
    * Again, this is because reservations are linked to the tables themselves and if the user alters the list of tables, the reservations will not be in sync.

#### Future Implementations

In the future implementations, we plan to allow editing of tables and allowing the user to shift reservations to specific tables if they want to overwrite the original assigned table.

Checks have to be implemented to ensure that the reservations-table pairings are still valid.

This will allow for greater flexibility for restaurant managers where they can manually assign seats to certain reservations (e.g. Assigning a big table to a small group of VIPs even though the table space is not optimized)

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedRhrh`. It extends `Rhrh` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `rhrhStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedRhrh#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedRhrh#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedRhrh#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitRhrh()`, `Model#undoRhrh()` and `Model#redoRhrh()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedRhrh` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitRhrh()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `rhrhStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitRhrh()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `rhrhStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitRhrh()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `rhrhStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoRhrh()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial Rhrh state, then there are no previous Rhrh states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoRhrh()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoRhrh()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `rhrhStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone Rhrh states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoRhrh()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitRhrh()`, `Model#undoRhrh()` or `Model#redoRhrh()`. Thus, the `rhrhStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitRhrh()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `rhrhStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* managers of restaurant in charge of overseeing the list of customers, employees and suppliers
* has a need to manage a significant number of contacts
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* can type fast
* prefers typing to mouse interactions
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

**Value proposition**: This application is created with the purpose of helping restaurant managers to manage the employeesâ€™ information (shift schedule, contact), diners (reservation timing, diner contacts) and suppliers (supplier meet up timing/weekly collection schedule, contacts), and at the same time manage contacts faster than a typical mouse/GUI driven app
